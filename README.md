# Instructions on building/running the container, an explanation of your approach, and bonus deployment considerations

docker build -t 1sdc0d3r/devops-starwars:1.0 .

# Documentation: Is the README clear and does it provide all required instructions for building and running the solution?


Your README.md should include:

A brief explanation of your approach.
Step-by-step instructions on how to build the Docker image and run the container.
Any additional notes on assumptions or design choices.
Optional Bonus Section:
A section discussing production deployment considerations (see below).


Bonus: Production Deployment Considerations

For candidates looking to demonstrate additional aptitude, please include a section in your README (or a separate document) outlining how you would deploy this solution in a production environment. Your discussion should cover, but is not limited to, the following topics:

Container Orchestration & Scaling:

Deployment using orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm).
Strategies for scaling the application (e.g., auto-scaling based on load).
Monitoring & Logging:

Tools and techniques to monitor the applicationâ€™s health and performance.
Strategies for centralized logging (e.g., ELK Stack, Fluentd).
CI/CD Pipeline:

How you would integrate your Docker build process into a CI/CD pipeline.
Steps for automated testing, security scanning, and deployment.
Security & Reliability:

Security considerations (e.g., vulnerability scanning, minimal base images, secrets management).
Ensuring reliability and availability (e.g., health checks, redundancy, fault tolerance).
Configuration Management:

Handling configuration settings for different environments (development, staging, production) using environment variables or configuration files.
